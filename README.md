## 📊 Database Schema

The Flask application uses SQLite with the following tables:

## 🔧 Configuration

### Email Settings
Configure your Gmail credentials in the `.env` file:
- `EMAIL_USER`: Your Gmail address
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Your Gmail App Password

### Monitoring Intervals
- **Flask App**: Checks every 30 seconds

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Rate Limiting
- The application includes delays between requests to be respectful to the Pukkelpop servers
- Streamlit version caches results for 60 seconds
- Don't modify the delay intervals without good reason

### Email Delivery
- Uses Gmail SMTP with SSL encryption
- Requires Gmail App Passwords (not regular passwords)
- Check spam folder if emails aren't received

### Legal Considerations
- This tool is for personal use only
- Respect the terms of service of the Pukkelpop website
- Don't abuse the monitoring frequency

## 🛡️ Security

- Environment variables are used for sensitive data
- Database and `.env` files are excluded from version control
- Email credentials are never logged or displayed
